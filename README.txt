Websoc. I'd planned it to be an operating system which operates on - well, the web. It's not done, you'll notice if you look at it or try and run it. 
I'm putting it here so that I eventually work on it later, but right now I'm just not passionate about it and can't see myself continuing it. 
I'm hoping eventually my interest in it is renewed and I will finish it then.
The goal for websoc is to create a web-based operating system and social media platform, based on krisbd's below-average webdows. 
I could just fork his project and go from there, 
but I'd rather make my own. It will be a social media platform, allowing users to interact with each other in quite a few ways. 
My goal is to make the entire thing extremely customizable. It will have a customizable taskbar, backgrounds, et cetera. 
I have already made a web based chatting service before, which has been lost to time on my old laptop which was converted over to a bajillion different 
versions of linux. This is what gave me the idea, the fact that I already have experience making user chatrooms and the desire I had to make a webOS. 
Right now its incomplete, as I continue to work on other projects I am more interested in at the moment.
